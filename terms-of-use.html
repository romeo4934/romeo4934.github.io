    <p>To subscribe, Users must select the "subscribe" option after choosing to "make it regular" for a crypto transaction. Subscriptions are subject to the terms and conditions herein and any additional terms presented to the User at the time of subscription.</p>
    <p>Subscription payments are automatically processed according to the selected frequency of the transaction (e.g., weekly, monthly). The User must provide and maintain a valid payment method. If a payment cannot be processed, the Subscription Service may be suspended or cancelled.</p>
    <p>Users may cancel their subscription at any time through their account settings on the Website. Upon cancellation, the subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle.</p>

    <h2>8. REFUND POLICY</h2>
    <p>Our refund policy applies specifically to funds received from customers for virtual currency exchanges conducted through our Website.</p>
    <p>Please note that once exchanges for fiat and virtual currency are completed using our services, they become final and non-refundable. Transactions are irrevocable once cryptocurrency is sent to the specified wallet address. Accuracy in providing the correct wallet address during the transaction is crucial.</p>
    <p>Refunds are only applicable for transactions that have not been successful. Incomplete, incorrect data, or suspicious transactions will not be eligible for refunds. Moreover, transactions involving high risk (e.g., suspected stolen funds, potential involvement in illegal activities) may result in freezing the funds for further investigation.</p>
    <p>Customers seeking a refund should contact www.trustramp.eu, providing the transaction number for reference.</p>
    <p>All crypto refunds are processed at the user's expense and are subject to applicable network fees. The refunded amount may be lower than the original deposit due to these fees. TrustRamp is not responsible for any losses incurred due to network fee fluctuations or incorrect wallet addresses provided by the user. Refunds may be issued under various circumstances, including but not limited to the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Risk Controls: If a transaction is blocked due to internal risk control procedures.</li>
        <li>Bank Rejection: If the user’s bank rejects the payout and no valid alternative account is provided.</li>
        <li>Market Unavailability: If the selected trading pair becomes unavailable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For crypto to fiat transactions, refunds will be issued to the original wallet address from which the funds were sent. In circumstances where the original address is no longer accessible or is a shared wallet, such as an exchange hot wallet, the customer may request a refund to a new address, subject to successful completion of live verification to confirm the identity of the claimant and the ownership of the new address.</p>
    <p>Fake or imitation tokens that mimic legitimate projects but do not match the official contract address are considered without value. In instances where such tokens are deposited, our systems will not recognize these as valid. No exchanges or refunds will be processed for fake or imitation tokens received at our deposit addresses.</p>
    <p>Our platform only accepts one deposit per one transaction ID. If multiple deposits are made under a single transaction ID, the customer must contact support to rectify the situation, which may include a refund depending on the case specifics.</p>
    <p>Transactions that do not meet the minimum limit requirements as specified on our Website will not be processed. Customers who send deposits below these limits may only receive refunds, subject to our standard refund procedures.</p>
    <p>Unsupported digital assets sent to wallets that do not correspond to the network or token type supported by our Company will not be extracted or returned. Decisions regarding such digital assets will be made on a case-by-case basis, with the final decision resting with the Company.</p>
    <p>Subscription payments are non-refundable, given the nature of the services provided. This includes any fees associated with the recurring purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies as per the subscription terms agreed upon by the User. However, in the event of a service failure directly attributable to TrustRamp, such as a failure to execute a transaction as scheduled due to technical issues on our part, Users may be eligible for a refund equivalent to the transaction value affected by the service failure.</p>
    <p>Refunds are facilitated through various methods, including SEPA (bank transfer), SWIFT, Faster Payments, or in virtual currency form.</p>
    <p>Refund processing time to the user's bank account may take up to 10 business days, subject to each bank's internal policies, which our company cannot influence.</p>
